## Directions to run the model and visualize results.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

All you need is code files (.gms) of Contract and Market-Contract price models. The code file has all the inputs defined and it will automatically create all the output files. 
Note: A valid GAMS model is required to run the model.

For example: Contract Price Model. Copy the download .gms file (e.g. April18_Sat_Sun_Weekday_Model.gms) and save that file in the same folder you have created and saved your GAMS project. After saving the file, you just have to press F9 or run button available in the top bar of GAMS IDE interface.  The model will create all the output files except the file named "Graphs". That Graph file is designed seperately to visualize the results. Similar procedure is applicable for Market-Contract Price Model.
