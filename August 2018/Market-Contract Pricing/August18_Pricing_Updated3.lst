      Description: This model was developed to qaunitfy the trade-off between nu
      mber of steady low flow days and hydropower revenue objectives.
                  The model has 2 periods per day (i.e. pHigh and plow), three d
      istinct day types(Sunday,Saturday, and Weekday) and runs for a month. we h
      ave used linear programming to solve the problem.
                  All the structural and operational constraints for Glen Canyon
       Dam applied here are uptodate.
